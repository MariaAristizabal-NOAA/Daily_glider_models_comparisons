# Daily_glider_models_comparisons

I use this set of files to create the daily glider-data/models comparisons that can be found at 
https://rucool.marine.rutgers.edu/hurricane/Hurricane_season_2019/

The scripts are run daily to produce these figures are:
Daily_map_North_Atlantic_gliders_in_DAC.py
Daily_glider_profiles_vs_models.py
Daily_glider_profiles_vs_Doppio.py
